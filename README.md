# Neatline 3
React app and API providing map and markup support, standalone but intended to be embedded in Omeka (or similar CMS), built around Leaflet.

NB: This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). If you want the guide for that it's [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Setup Dev Environment
This repository provides the core functionality - an API and an interface for editing exhibits and records. Additionally it can be used as extension to Omeka-S after it is wrapped in [this repository](https://github.com/performant-software/neatline-omeka-s).

This should be expanded with instructions, in the meantime here's a [diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tKu8S7ppeVvBOj55q3IfuHQpg7v-hE1T/view?usp=sharing) to get you started.
