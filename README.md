## Neatline 3 single page application

This repository contains the front end components of Neatline, a suite of tools for scholars, students, and curators to tell stories with maps and timelines. Neatline 3 is in early development. This application relies on a separate back end adapter to provide API endpoints for its data storage and retrieval. The adapter for [Omeka S](http://omeka.org/s/) is maintained at https://github.com/performant-software/neatline-omeka-s.

### Installing and development setup
This repository is included as a git submodule in the Neatline adapter for Omeka S. To use an Omeka S instance as the environment for Neatline 3 installation and/or development, please see the instructions at https://github.com/performant-software/neatline-omeka-s.
